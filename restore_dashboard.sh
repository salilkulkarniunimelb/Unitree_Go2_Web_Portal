# restore_dashboard.sh - ONE-COMMAND restore of the QOD Lab Go2 map dashboard.
#
# Run from YOUR LAPTOP. Fully self-contained: recreates the robot_hivemind
# container if missing (from the snapshot image, which has the code, Python
# deps and the auto-boot entrypoint baked in), syncs the latest files,
# verifies deps/ffmpeg, starts the portal, opens the SSH tunnel, and opens
# the dashboard in your browser.
#
# The container runs with --restart unless-stopped and its entrypoint
# (boot.sh) auto-starts the portal on every server boot / docker restart, so
# the dashboard comes back on its own even if the machine reboots.
#
# Usage:
#   bash restore_dashboard.sh
#
# After breaking lab_portal.py:  git checkout 29555bd -- lab_portal.py && bash restore_dashboard.sh
